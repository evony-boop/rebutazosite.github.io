            From Page 1 to Page 5, this project shows how faith and technology can work together in meaningful ways.
            The journey begins by putting God first, reminding us that our actions, decisions, and use of technology
            should be guided by faith.
            Through personal reflection, we learn how faith shapes our daily lives and influences how we use digital
            tools responsibly.

            <br>
            The project also highlights the importance of serving others and being responsible in the digital world.
            By understanding community service and digital ethics, we are reminded to use technology with respect,
            honesty, and care for others.
            These values help create a safe and positive online environment where kindness and integrity are practiced.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the final page, the message of being the Light of the World brings everything together.
            This project proves that when technology is used with faith, purpose, and ethical responsibility,
            it can inspire, inform, and uplift others. By living out these values online and offline,
            we become good examples and responsible digital citizens who reflect God’s love through technology.
