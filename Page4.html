        Digital Ethics is the responsible and moral use of technology guided by faith, respect, and honesty. 
        In this project, digital ethics shows how technology can be used to reflect the value of 
        “Una ang Ginoo” by doing what is right even in the digital world. As students, we are called to use websites, 
        social media, and digital tools in a way that shows kindness, integrity, and respect for others.
    <br>
    <br>
      Practicing digital ethics means being respectful and truthful online. 
    We avoid cyberbullying, spreading fake news, and copying content without permission. 
    Instead, we communicate positively, respect privacy, and follow digital rules and copyrights. 
    By being honest and responsible online, we show good character and become a good example to others.

      Technology becomes meaningful when it is used for good purposes. 
      Through this webpage, we use digital skills to inspire, inform, and uplift others. 
      When faith and technology work together, we become a “Light of the World,” using technology not to 
      harm but to spread positivity, values, and hope.
