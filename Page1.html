        Putting God first in my life helps me make better decisions and reminds me to always choose what is right. 
        “Una ang Ginoo” means trusting God in everything I do, whether in school, online, or in my daily actions.
        As the Light of the World, I believe that even through technology, I can spread kindness, honesty, and respect. 
        This project shows that when faith guides our use of technology, we can inspire others and create positive change 
        in the digital world.
